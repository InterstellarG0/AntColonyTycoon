## Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and the public can rely upon. The following considerations for the public also apply to creators and the public should follow them in order to make use of the licensed material.

1. **Public License Considerations**: When the public uses Creative Commons-licensed material made available under these terms and conditions, the licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material subject to the terms and conditions of the public license. If permission is not required for any reason, that use is not regulated by the license. The licenses only grant permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. The licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
